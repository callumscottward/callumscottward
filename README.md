- Hey, this is Callum!
- I'm currently a sophomore at the University of Nebraska Omaha majoring in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Studio Art.
- My GitHub page is a little limited at the moment as I haven't yet gotten super in-depth in my major, but expect to see much more miscellaneous project work over the next few months/years.
